Monetary policy discussion  It was noted that Mikael Apel, Hans Dellmo and Hans Lindberg would draft the \\nminutes of §§1 and 2 on the agenda. \\n \\nThe meeting began with discussions of the factors in economic developments in Sweden and the rest of the world that are relevant for inflation prospects and the formulation of monetary policy (section 1). The discussion of each aspect \\nstarted from analyses and assessments compiled by the Economics Department \\nand the Monetary & Exchange Rate Policy Department. A technical assumption \\nin these analyses is that the Riksbank™s repo rate is held unchanged at 3.25 per ',\n",
       " ' 2cent up to the end of 2001 Q4. After that the Board discussed inflation prospects (section 2) and finally drew conclusions about the monetary policy situation (section 3).  \\n \\n1. Economic developments in Sweden and elsewhere \\n\\n 1.1 Prices in Sweden \\n \\nThe Board noted initially that consumer price tendencies in November and \\nDecember were broadly in line with the main scenario in the latest Inflation \\nReport, published in December 1999.  The 12-month changes in the CPI and UND1X in December 1999 were 1.2 and \\n1.9 per cent, respectively, which is 0.1 percentage point higher than envisaged \\nin the main scenario. At 1.5 per cent in December, underlying domestic \\ninflation, as measured by UNDINHX, is also marginally higher than expected. The upward shift in inflation in recent months is largely explained by higher prices for petrol and domestic heating oil in connection with rising world \\nmarket prices for crude oil. In other respects, consumer price tendencies have \\nbeen subdued. \\n Producer prices have gone on rising. The increases in import and home market prices in November and December exceeded expectations, mainly due to price \\nincreases for oil and other energy products. Moreover, the December business \\ntendency survey from the National Institute of Economic Research indicates \\nthat price increases are being planned by a growing number of manufacturers. All in all, the Board concluded that the rising producer prices can lead to somewhat higher inflationary pressure and in time have some impact on \\nconsumer prices. \\n \\n 1.2 International activity and inflation \\n \\nIn the December Inflation Report, annual GDP growth in the OECD area in the \\nperiod 1999Œ2001 was judged to average around 2.7 per cent. Inflation in the \\nOECD area was judged to move up gradually in this period from 1.4 per cent in 1999 to 2.0 per cent in 2001.  \\nThe Board noted that the economic trend in the United States remains strong. \\nConsumer confidence and share prices both rose to new records in December. \\nWith the strong domestic demand, the trade deficit has gone on growing markedly and unemployment is still falling. Even so, the consumer price tendency remains subdued. In December the 12-month change in the official \\nindex of underlying inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, was the \\nlowest since the 1960s. All in all, GDP growth in the United States in the coming \\nyears was judged to be somewhat higher than foreseen in the Inflation Report. At the same time, Board members were considerably concerned about the accumulated imbalances in the U.S. economy. Growth in the United Kingdom \\nwas likewise judged to be somewhat higher than expected earlier. ',\n",
       " ' 3 The upswing in the euro area was also judged to be marginally stronger than allowed for in the main scenario. Euro area activity has become increasingly balanced, as rising exports accompany the continuation of strong domestic \\ndemand. In recent months the rate of HICP inflation has moved up, to 1.7 per \\ncent in December; this is mainly explained by higher oil prices, together with \\nsome contribution from a weaker euro.  In Japan the economic recovery has tended to falter since the time of the \\nDecember Inflation Report. Private consumption has been weak, partly due to a \\nmarked fall in annual bonus wages; export growth has been subdued by the \\nstrong yen and investment is still falling. Compared with 1999, moreover, the government™s stimulatory package is smaller for 2000. The Board judged that growth in Japan will be lower than was assumed in the Inflation Report. \\n \\nSumming up, the Board noted that international economic prospects showed \\nsome improvement compared with assessments in the December Report and this may lead to a somewhat stronger external price trend. A Board member pointed out that the upward international trend is relatively synchronised. Price \\nincreases for commodities and intermediate goods have been followed, as usual \\nduring a broad upswing, by rising prices for agricultural products as well. \\nExternal inflationary pressure is therefore moving up and is probably stronger than the majority of Board members perceive.  \\n \\n1.3 Financial markets \\n\\n The Board noted that bond rates in the United States and the euro area have risen in recent months, partly in view of persistently strong growth and \\nimproved economic prospects, respectively. Bond rates in Japan have risen in \\nconnection with large issues and signals that monetary policy will become more \\nrestrictive during the year if growth picks up.  Swedish bond rates have followed the international trend but have not risen as \\nmuch as elsewhere. Since the publication of the December Inflation Report the \\nSwedish ten-year rate has moved up around 0.4 percentage points but the \\ndifferential with the German rate has narrowed from about 0.5 to 0.4 percentage points. The upward shift in both Swedish and international bond rates since the December Report is larger than had been expected. The Board \\nfound it reasonable to expect that the level of Swedish and international long-\\nterm rates this year will presumably be somewhat higher than assumed in the \\nDecember Report.  Instrumental rates have been raised since the turn of the year by a number of \\ncentral banks. While the meeting was in progress, the ECB announced an \\ninstrumental rate increase of 0.25 percentage points. The Federal Reserve \\nrecently raised its instrumental rate by 0.25 percentage points and the latest statements from that quarter are leading market players to expect further increases in the coming months. The Bank of England raised its repo rate by \\n0.25 percentage points in the middle of January and in view of tendencies in ',\n",
       " ' 4markets for labour and housing, market players appear to count on further increases.  The Board noted that, according to survey data, virtually all market analysts \\nexpect that at today™s meeting the Riksbank will raise the repo rate by at least \\n0.25 percentage points. The analysts™ considerations include higher-than-\\nexpected inflation in December, higher inflation expectations and statements by the Riksbank Governor to the effect that a monetary tightening is on the future agenda. \\n \\nIn recent months the TCW exchange rate index has fluctuated between 124 and \\n125, which is a marginally weaker tendency than foreseen in the December Inflation Report. A Board member noted that potential growth in the United States may have moved up in recent years, in which case the dollar may remain \\nhigh for longer than assumed earlier. \\n \\nUnder these circumstances and the assessment that international growth may be somewhat stronger than forecast earlier, the Board considered that the krona may appreciate somewhat more slowly than foreseen in the Report™s main \\nscenario. \\n \\nThe Board noted that share prices in Sweden have gone on rising since the turn of the year and that stock markets in the United States and several other countries have been volatile. \\n \\n \\n1.4 Import prices \\n In the main scenario for the Inflation Report it had been judged that in 2000 \\nand 2001 the import price trend for consumer goods would be weak, mainly \\ndue to a restrained international price tendency and a successive appreciation \\nof the krona. Moreover, the barrel price of crude oil had been expected to move up to about USD 25 towards the end of 1999 and then fall back by degrees to about USD 19 in 2001. The Board noted that the oil price had continued to \\nrise in December and the average outcome had been about USD 1 higher than \\nforecast. Since then the price has fluctuated around an average level of USD 26. \\nForward oil prices have risen but still indicate a downward tendency. Two Board members pointed out that the oil price rise in the past year has mainly reflected the OPEC decision to cut oil output but that recent tendencies have come to a \\ngreater extent from rising international demand. A third member considered \\nthat such a marked oil price rise as in the past year may lead to OPEC \\nproduction quotas being broken so that the price falls back. The Board concluded that in the coming two years the average price of oil will probably be somewhat higher than was foreseen in the December Report, though the future \\nprice is highly uncertain. \\n \\nThe Board then noted that other commodity prices have also been stronger than expected. Considering the probability that international growth will be somewhat stronger than foreseen in the December Report, the Board judged \\nthat other international prices may also rise somewhat more than expected ',\n",
       " ' 5earlier. Together with a somewhat slower appreciation of the krona, this implies that import prices for consumer goods will probably be stronger than assumed in the latest Inflation Report. 1.5 Demand and supply \\n\\n \\nSweden™s GDP growth rate was judged in the December Inflation Report to be \\n3.4 per cent in 1999, 3.7 per cent in 2000 and 3.3 per cent in 2001. The rapid expansion of total demand was judged successively to bring the unutilised resources into production. \\n \\nThe Board noted that exports during 1999 seem to have been broadly in line \\nwith the assessment in the December Report. The somewhat better international prospects, together with a slower appreciation of the krona and higher international export prices, are expected to have a slight positive effect \\non Swedish exports in 2000 and 2001. Judging from the national accounts and \\nnew statistics on trade in goods, the outcome for imports in 1999 was weaker \\nthan assumed in the Inflation Report.  Household consumption in the first three quarters of 1999 rose 4 per cent from \\nthe corresponding period the year before. The increase was particularly strong \\nin the third quarter. Household confidence is high and spending plans as \\nsurveyed by Statistics Sweden point to a continuation of strongly rising consumption. Similar indications are found in the November retailing figures from Statistics Sweden and the December figures from the Wholesale & Retail \\nResearch Institute. \\n \\nNew car registrations in December 1999 were 48 per cent higher than a year earlier, the largest increase in the 1990s. Car sales contribute more than one percentage point to private consumption™s estimated annual growth in 1999. \\nFactors behind the steeply rising car sales in 1999 probably include an old stock \\nof cars, falling relative prices and the prospect of some tax increases in 2000. \\nBut the trend for car sales is expected to remain strong this year.  The 12-month change in the narrow money supply (M0) moved up from 9 per \\ncent in November to 12 per cent in December. The upward tendency points to \\na continuation of the strong trend for retailing in particular. \\n The Board concluded that the recent information calls for an upward revision of the consumption forecast compared with the main scenario in the December \\nReport. A Board member noted that the strong stock market has generated \\nhigh asset values that are likely to result in increased private consumption in the \\ncoming years. Another member pointed out that in addition to the strong price trend for shares and real estate, fiscal policy is less restrictive than before and this can also be expected to strengthen private consumption. A third member \\nunderscored the significance in this context of the budget work in the spring. In \\nthe political parties that support the Government there seem to be strong \\nadvocates of increased public expenditure; this will now be considered in relation to the targets that the Riksdag (Sweden™s parliament) has established for government finances. A fourth member observed that the rapid growth of ',\n",
       " ' 6various money and credit aggregates indicates a continuation of strong private consumption.  The national accounts for 1999 Q3 present a fairly extensive revision of the \\noutcome for gross fixed capital formation in the first half-year. With the marked \\ndownward revision of the Q2 volume of manufacturing investment, the change \\nfrom the same quarter a year earlier is negative for both Q2 and Q3. The outcomes for the energy sector and the public authorities in the first two quarters have also been revised downwards. This means that the volume trend \\nfor gross fixed investment in 1999 was probably weaker than foreseen in the \\nDecember Report. For 2000 and 2001, however, investment prospects are \\nsubstantially unchanged. Interest rates for longer maturities may be higher than envisaged in the December Report but this should mainly be a consequence of the better international activity and its effects on economic activity in Sweden. \\nFor stockbuilding, on the other hand, the picture in the national accounts for \\nthe first three quarter of 1999 is in line with the assessment in the Inflation \\nReport and future prospects are unchanged.  All in all, the Board concluded that the new information since the December \\nReport reinforces the picture of a strong and broad economic upswing. GDP \\ngrowth in 1999 may have been marginally higher than foreseen in the main \\nscenario and growth prospects for 2000 and 2001 have also improved.  Labour market tendencies are broadly in line with assessments in the December \\nReport; employment rose during most of 1999, though at a declining rate. \\nIncreased employment contributed to a weakening of labour productivity in \\n1998 and probably in 1999 as well. However, the assessment in the December Report may have underestimated the path of labour productivity in 1999, partly because the increase in employment towards the end of the year was somewhat \\nless than had been expected. Still, with a continuation of the strong increase in \\nthe number of new job vacancies in the latter part of 1999, the Board found \\nsupport for a good employment trend in 2000. At 33,000, the number of new vacancies in December was the highest for this month since 1989.  \\nManufacturing activity, which had slackened temporarily during 1998, seems to \\nhave recovered, with a stabilisation towards the end of 1999. The December \\nbusiness tendency survey, like the purchasing managers index (ICI) for November and December, point to good industrial activity with no signs of increased capacity shortages. The shortage figure for skilled labour in \\nmanufacturing, which had risen appreciably in the three preceding business \\ntendency surveys, stabilised in December. The shortage of salaried technicians \\nwas also unchanged from the previous survey. In some manufacturing sectors, however, there were signs of other types of capacity restrictions that may have been due to rearrangements in production and delayed deliveries of inputs, for \\nexample. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing declined from 85 per cent in \\nSeptember to 83 per cent in December. \\n All in all, the Board saw no reason to alter the assessment of current resource utilisation in manufacturing. It was noted that the economy™s unutilised \\nresources at present will be brought into production as demand grows. One ',\n",
       " ' 7Board member found it probable, however, that the stock of unutilised resources is already more or less exhausted. One sign of this is that the labour market situation is already comparatively strained, for instance due to educational factors and an insufficient geographical mobility among job \\nseekers. \\n \\n1.6 Wages  The overall wage level was judged in the Inflation Report™s main scenario to rise \\n3.2 per cent in 1999, 4.2 per cent in 2000 and 4.5 per cent in 2001. \\n \\nSince the publication of the December Report, the wage tendency has been marginally weaker than expected. But as some wage agreements involve wage adjustments at intervals of more than twelve months, the statistics are difficult to \\ninterpret. New wage data suggest that the rate of wage increases is lower, if \\nanything, than forecast earlier. Still, the Board found no grounds at present for \\nrevising the picture of wage developments in the latest Inflation Report.   \\n1.7 Rents, interest expenditure and price effects from \\nderegulations, trade liberalisation and political decisions  Deregulations and trade liberalisation were judged in the December Inflation Report to have an annual downward price effect in 2000 and 2001 of between \\n0.1 and 0.3 percentage points. Changes in indirect taxes and subsidies, together \\nwith altered household expenditure on interest, were judged to hold back CPI \\ninflation in 1999 and 2000 by 0.6 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively, followed by an upward effect of 0.3 percentage points in 2001.  \\nThe Board noted that no new information had been received about consumer \\nprice effects from indirect taxes and subsidies but higher mortgage rates may \\nmake the contribution from households™ interest expenditure somewhat higher than in the December Report™s main scenario.  \\nThe Board drew attention to indications that downward price pressure on \\ntelecommunication products in 2000 may be somewhat greater than assumed \\nearlier. Price cuts have been announced by Telia, together with a decision to open the access net in 2000 Q1. In that subscribers™ freedom to choose call operators is extended to the choice of access operator, the increased \\ncompetition is expected to subdue prices. \\n \\nThe public housing utilities™ rent negotiations for 2000 are still in progress but rent increases in January 2000 may be lower than assumed in the December Report. The contribution to CPI inflation may then be 0.1Œ0.2 percentage \\npoints less than expected earlier. However, the lower rent increases in January \\nmay be followed by a higher rate later on, due to rising long-term interest rates \\nand higher oil prices. Still, it looks on the whole as though the rent trend in the near future will be weaker than foreseen in the Inflation Report.  \\n ',\n",
       " \" 81.8 Inflation expectations \\n Two surveys of inflation expectations have been published since the December Inflation Report. Taken together, they show an upward shift in expectations of \\ninflation one year ahead. No new information is available about expectations of \\ninflation in the medium and longer term. \\n Households™ expectations of inflation one year ahead have moved up since the December Report and were 1.9 per cent in January as against 1.3 per cent in the \\nNovember survey. The one-year rates expected by manufacturers and service \\nindustries in December were 1.7 and 1.5 per cent, respectively, which in both \\ncases is an upward shift of 0.2 percentage points from the September survey.  The Board concluded that to a high degree the rising short-term expectations \\nof inflation have been governed by the current increase in inflation and largely \\nconfirm the Riksbank™s appraisal of inflation. \\n  2. The Board's assessment of inflation prospects \\n\\n \\nIn the main scenario of the December Inflation Report it was considered that \\nthe 12-month rate of CPI inflation would be 1.4 per cent in December 2000 and 2.3 per cent in December 2001. The corresponding rates of underlying inflation, measured as UND1X, were judged to be 1.8 and 2.2 per cent. There \\nwas a perceived risk, however, of labour market shortages, for example, being \\nmore pronounced than assumed in the main scenario and of the import price \\ntrend being stronger. This in turn could generate higher inflationary pressure. The overall assessment, including the risk spectrum, was therefore that the mean level of UND1X inflation would be 0.1 percentage point higher than in \\nthe main scenario, that is, 1.9 per cent one year ahead and 2.3 per cent after two \\nyears. \\n  2.1 The monetary policy group™s view \\n\\n \\nThe Board™s discussion of inflation prospects was preceded by a presentation of \\na corresponding discussion in the Bank's monetary policy group.1  In the light of the material that had been assembled for the Board meeting, a \\nmajority of the members of the monetary policy group had considered that the \\nrecent statistics pointed to inflation being marginally higher than in the main \\nscenario, mainly as a result of somewhat better economic prospects in Sweden and elsewhere. In the short run, however, it seemed that UND1X inflation would probably be somewhat lower than in the main scenario, chiefly because \\nrent increases would be lower than expected earlier and downward pressure on \\ntelecommunications prices would be stronger.                                                 1 The group is made up of Riksbank staff and is\\n headed by one of the deputy governors. The \\nmain features of the group™s discussion are presented at the Board meeting. The opinions \\nexpressed in the minutes are not necessarily shared by all the members of the group, including \\nthe chairperson. \\n\",\n",
       " ' 9  2.2 The Board™s discussion \\n \\nThe Board noted to begin with that in the ensuing discussion of inflation \\nprospects and the formation of monetary policy, it is reasonable in the current \\nsituation to disregard the calculated effects from indirect taxes, subsidies and interest expenditure because these factors are not judged to exert a permanent effect on either inflation or inflation expectations. \\n \\nIn the past year the rising price of oil has played an important part in inflation™s \\nupward trend. At the same time, the comparatively moderate increase in UND1X inflation that is foreseen in the coming two years presupposes that oil prices fall back. The Board noted that difficult issues are involved when \\ndetermining how oil price movements ought to influence the formation of \\nmonetary policy. In certain cases, oil price movements can be seen as a supply \\nshock with effects on inflation that are mainly transitory; in such cases they should be accorded secondary importance in the formation of monetary policy. In other cases, oil price movements may mirror a shift in international and \\ndomestic demand. It is also conceivable that their impact will be more \\npermanent, for example through knock-on effects in later stages of processing \\nand ultimately in the formation of expectations. The possibility of determining the characteristics of an oil price movement and its consequences in advance are no doubt very limited. All in all, the Board considered that in the present \\nsituation the different aspects of the oil price rise cannot be distinguished \\nsatisfactorily. Neither can oil price effects on prices in general be entirely \\ndisregarded, for instance because the recent prise rise for oil is partly connected with the global economic improvement. The following discussion of inflation prospects therefore focused on UND1X inflation. \\n \\nFour Board members concluded that within the Riksbank™s target horizon, \\nUND1X inflation will be somewhat higher than foreseen in the Inflation Report. In the near future, however, inflation may be lower than envisaged in the main scenario, mainly as a consequence of a subdued rent trend and strong \\nprice competition in the telecommunications market. The new information in \\nrecent months has reinforced the impression of a strong, broad economic \\nupswing in Sweden as well as abroad. A GDP growth rate around 4 per cent this year seems entirely feasible. A stronger trend than expected earlier is foreseen not least for domestic private consumption, partly in view of greatly increased \\nasset values. At the same time, somewhat higher international price pressure \\nmeans that inflation in Sweden will probably be less subdued by this factor. \\nThese members considered that growth will probably be somewhat stronger and inflation somewhat higher than in the assessment that a majority of the monetary policy group had supported. \\n \\nA fifth Board member shared the view that economic prospects have improved \\nand that UND1X inflation will probably be higher than foreseen in the December Report™s main scenario but considered that these revisions are probably somewhat smaller than the majority™s assessment implies and more in \\nline with the opinion of the monetary policy group. ',\n",
       " ' 10 The sixth Board member considered that the acceleration of inflation will exceed the majority™s assessment by around two tenths of a percentage point, partly due to stronger external inflationary pressure and the Swedish economy \\nbeing close to full capacity utilisation. \\n \\nIn this context a Board member pointed out that while external price pressure has admittedly become stronger than the Riksbank envisaged last autumn, the overall consumer price trend has been largely in line with earlier assessments. \\nSo other prices must have followed a weaker path than expected earlier. Why \\nthis has happened despite stronger growth is an interesting question. One \\nwould expect to see higher wage drift as well as growing price pressure in more and more markets for goods, not least now that the economy™s unutilised resources are coming to an end. There are certain signs of increased price \\npressure but they are limited. Wage tendencies are weaker, if anything, than the \\nBoard™s majority counted on. Against this background it is important to evaluate \\nnew information continuously and be prepared to reassess earlier relationships if that is called for.  \\nAnother Board member considered that domestic inflation™s fairly restrained \\npath to date should not be seen as a sign of far-reaching structural changes in a \\npositive direction. When a country has a credible policy for price stability, inflation probably occurs relatively late in the business cycle.  \\nA number of Board members expressed concern about the extent to which the \\nsupply side of the economy will be capable of adapting to the comparatively \\nstrong demand that is foreseen. One Board member pointed out that so far there are few signs of a counterpart to the very strong investment trend in the United States, where it has probably contributed to the high productivity and \\nrestrained development of prices in recent years. The member considered that \\nthis might indicate that improved productivity growth in Sweden in recent years \\nis more of a temporary phenomenon than in the case of the United States. Another Board member pointed out, however, that comparisons with the United States in this respect are difficult, partly because capacity utilisation in \\nthe U.S. economy has been high for so long. \\n \\n 3 The Board™s assessment of the monetary policy situation \\n \\n3.1 The monetary policy group™s view  \\nThe monetary policy group had noted that the December inflation forecast could have motivated a repo rate increase. However, the rate had not been raised, partly out of consideration for the millennium transition. The \\ninformation since then had reinforced the impression of a strong, broad \\nupswing which could be expected to lead to growing inflationary pressure as \\nunutilised resources are brought into production. Both domestic and international activity were judged to be marginally stronger than foreseen in the Inflation Report and this was expected to contribute to marginally higher \\ninflation in two years™ time. Even with the repo rate increase last November, ',\n",
       " ' 11monetary policy must still be regarded as expansionary. All in all, the policy group had therefore found grounds for continuing to make monetary policy less expansionary.  \\nThe policy group had discussed the size of the repo rate adjustment that was \\ncalled for and whether there were grounds for adjusting the lending and/or \\ndeposit rate (the repo rate corridor). As regards the latter question, the group had considered that the lending and deposit rates should not be changed because there is still clearly enough room in the corridor for future repo rate \\nincreases. Neither were there reasons for adjusting the corridor in order to \\ninfluence expectations of future monetary policy. Today, communication in the \\nform of the Inflation Report and minutes of Board meetings, for instance, is just as effective in this respect.  \\nThe policy group™s dominant, though not entirely unanimous, opinion had \\nbeen that a repo rate increase of 0.25 percentage points appeared most natural, \\neven allowing for the shift in inflation expectations in a marginally more pessimistic direction. The main reason for not raising the repo rate by more than 0.25 percentage points was that there had been no substantial upward \\nrevision of inflation prospects. Moreover, an increase of this magnitude was \\nconsidered to be most in line with how the Riksbank had acted earlier. \\n  3.2 The Board™s discussion \\n\\n \\nAll the Board members noted that there had been a continuation of the already \\nfavourable economic trend in Sweden as well as internationally and that there seems to have been some improvement in growth prospects since the December Inflation Report. The current expansionary monetary stance is tending to \\nreinforce the overall growth of domestic demand. This is not sustainable in the \\nlonger run and is liable to lead to overheating and the negative effects that this \\noften has on real economic activity when it is followed by an abrupt downturn. A gradual realignment to less expansionary conditions is therefore necessary in order to provide a good foundation for the continuation of a favourable \\neconomic trend with stable prices, sustainable growth and increased \\nemployment. The Board members accordingly agreed that a continued \\nmonetary policy realignment to less expansionary conditions is needed and much of the subsequent discussion focused on a repo rate increase™s appropriate magnitude. \\n \\nOne Board member considered that repo rate increases of both 0.25 and 0.50 \\npercentage points are conceivable. Inflation prospects have admittedly not been revised all that much but even an increase of 0.50 percentage points would probably bring inflation two years ahead approximately into line with the target \\nbecause there was some ‚leeway™ from December to make up for. Real interest \\nrates are low and the picture of activity suggests that further repo rate increases \\nwill be needed. In this situation the size of the increase is partly a tactical matter. There is something to be said for a clear declaration of intent. But if the rate is raised 0.50 percentage points, it is important that this is not presented in a \\nmanner that seems alarming because there are no reasons for that. ',\n",
       " ' 12 Three Board members agreed with this and stated that increases of both 0.25 and 0.50 percentage points can be considered. In the opinion of one these members, an increase in between 0.25 and 0.5 percentage points is also \\nconceivable. The members also underscored the importance of clarifying that in \\nthe event of an increase of 0.50 percentage points, this should not be \\ninterpreted as a signal from the Riksbank that inflation prospects have been reassessed more substantially.  \\nOne Board member considered that inflation prospects call for a repo rate \\nincrease of 0.50 percentage points. The monetary stance is markedly \\nexpansionary at the same time as fiscal policy is becoming less restrictive. Economic activity, which is already strong, is then liable to generate unduly strong demand pressure two years ahead. The member considered that in the \\npresent cyclical phase, monetary policy ought to be appreciably closer to a \\nneutral stance. Otherwise, more vigorous monetary policy measures may be \\nnecessary at a later stage in the business cycle, in which case there would be a risk of monetary policy accentuating cyclical movements instead of contributing to sustainable growth with stable prices. \\n \\nA number of Board members also considered that the present repo rate is \\nprobably a bit below what might be regarded as a neutral level and that, in view of the strong activity, taking a comparatively large step towards more normal conditions would be worthwhile. One Board member cited the rising inflation \\nexpectations and the resultant fall in real short-term interest rates as an \\nargument for a sizeable increase. \\n Five Board members concluded that the repo rate ought to be raised 0.5 percentage points. They emphasised that the increase is not to be taken to \\nrepresent a dramatic reassessment of inflation prospects in a more pessimistic \\ndirection but as an ambition to avoid the necessity of more vigorous measures at \\na later stage.  The sixth Board member considered that in the present situation a repo rate \\nincrease of 0.25 percentage points would be preferable. If the current \\ntendencies continue or are reinforced, this increase could soon be followed by \\nfurther increases. At the same time, the member pointed out that this position did not represent a fundamentally different view of the need for a monetary policy tightening and that even after an increase of 0.25 percentage points, \\nmonetary policy would be expansionary. Under these circumstances, the \\nmember saw no strong reasons for entering a reservation against the majority \\nview.  An adjustment of the deposit and lending rates (the repo rate corridor) was not \\nfound to be called for in this situation. \\n \\nThe Board finally concluded that a repo rate increase of 0.50 percentage points, to 3.75 per cent, would lead to a moderate increase in UND1X inflation so that within the Riksbank™s target horizon, this would be approximately in line with \\nthe target.
